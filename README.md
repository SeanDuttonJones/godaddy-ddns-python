# godaddy-ddns-python
A script that allows you to simulate a static IP address using the Go Daddy API.

It compares your current IP address to a Go Daddy domain and updates the domain if there is a discrepancy.

You will need to have a Go Daddy account to create public and private keys. Please note that once you create "test" keys, you will need to create "production" keys, which you will use in this script. 

You will need to have the "requests" package install for python in order for you use this script.
